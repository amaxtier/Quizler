This is a small game I created by using the open REST API of a trivia database. This is also a project created using OOP. The <main.py> file is where the magic happens, where everything is connected to work. The <data.py> is the file that gets response from the Trivia's database API as a json file, by parsing that information I generate my bank of questions for the game. The <question_model.py> manages the 'Question class', which we only take the questions text and the correct answee to work with. The <quiz_brain.py> file masanafes the 'Quizbrain' class which is basicallty the mechanic of the game, ogg how the questions are going to be portrayed, checking the validity of the answer and the functuion to move to the next question on the bank of questions. Last but not least, the <ui.py> manages the 'QuizInteraface' class, which just liek the name explains, works out the whole user interface of the Quiz game. Enjoy!
